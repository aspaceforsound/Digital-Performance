# Digital-Performance (Spring 2015)
These patches are part of my coursework at iTP-NYU, as part of Luke DuBois & Jamie Jewett's "Digital Performance" class. 

I am exploring ways to sync and control my audio and visuals through repurposing useless devices around my house. 

The Videos are not included for now, but will be scaled down.

These patches are good for the following:
Touch OSC: using button presses, faders, the accelerometer and gyroscope
Multiple Video Files: mixing video files together with a performance setup patch
Multiple Audio Files: smoothing out the data from an accelerometer and how you can use that to control filters and cue points

I am sharing these as documentation of my process for this course and my Thesis. It was also very hard to find these things, so I am putting them in one place.
Perhaps they will help you build something wonderful! If you have an easier way, or cleaner way of doing these things, please share!
If they inspire you in any way, or help get you "unstuck" please let me know, send or post a link!

(this is a work-in-progress)
